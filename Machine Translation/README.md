# Machine Translation

## Neural Machine Translation

In simple words Neural Machine Translation(NMT) refers to translation of text between languages using an artificial neural network.

In this project, we build NMT using seq2seq model to translate text from English to German.

## Dataset
Here we use German-English sentence pairs dataset from http://www.manythings.org/anki/. You can either clone this repo or download it from [here](http://www.manythings.org/anki/deu-eng.zip).
Thanks to http://www.manythings.org/anki/ ,this site provides us Tab-delimited Bilingual Sentence Pairs for various language pairs. You can use any of those datasets in our program for translating between other languages.

## Resources required
-Numpy

-Pandas

-Matplotlib

-sklearn

-re

-Tensorflow keras

## How do we do this?
We use the game changer seq2seq model, which made many NLP tasks possible and had been the building block of the present State-of-Art model of NLP.
With the seq2seq model, we use Attention mechanism to improve the model futher.
